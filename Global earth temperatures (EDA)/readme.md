## Important Update : As the Dataset is huge hence its compressed. 

# Global Earth Temperatures Analysis

During my research, it was found that there has been a global increasing trend in temperature, particularly over the last 30 years. This alarming trend is primarily attributed to the various activities of humankind, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In more developed countries, the rise in temperature started earlier, and over time, the accuracy of temperature observations has improved, which is a natural progression.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze global land temperatures and visualize the trends over time using Python and the "plotly" library. The goal is to provide insights into the temperature changes and emphasize the importance of addressing climate change through data-driven analysis and visualization.

## Key Features

- Analyze and visualize global land temperature data.
- Observe temperature trends over a specific time frame.
- Highlight the impact of human activities on global temperature rise.
- Raise awareness about the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Plotly (Python library for interactive data visualization)
